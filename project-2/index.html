      <p>Baking has always been in my blood. Before I could even read I was
         making cakes from <b>scratch</b>. I would watch my mom and see what
         ingredient went in what measuring implement. Simple! I will share
         with you an easy and delicious cookie recipe.</p>

        seen some pumpkin cookie recipes for sale on various sites, they were
        <s>$5</s>, but now are <i>free</i>. I hope you enjoy your cookies,
        and please share.</p>
