<h2>My readme.md</h2>

<p>So far so good. Will be adding comments as I go along to make sure I document
 everything I can.</p>
 <p>The index.html for project-2 went soooo much smoother than anything I did
 in project-1! I hope I have come close to what is required for this project. I
 really tried to get things done and right, but you never know.  I still am
 having a hard time finding my website and actually can't tell what my index
 even looks like.  I want to get the kinks worked out because I really am
 getting to like html!</p>
<p>Well, since I have already started in HTML, I will continue and make sure I
 do my next Readme in markdown!  I have changed the color of my index to orange
 to fit the pumpkin cookie recipe.  I also added a quote.  Now I will finish
 the rest of the assignment.</p>
