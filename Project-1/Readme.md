<p>I have been having so much trouble with <b>Atom</b>, that it is very frustrating. I think I have it all figured out, then <i>blam</i>, I'm all confused again.</p>
<hr />
I have searched the web to get help for dummies, but it just makes me more confused.  One of the websites I used is (www.w3schools.com/html.) A lot of great tutorials.</p>
<p>Below are some of my problem areas:</p>
<ol>
  <li>1.Github desktop</li>
  <li>2.Not being able to commit</li>
  <li>3.Being Confused</li>
  <li>4.Atom not downloading</li>
<ul>
  <li>Wish this was a face-to-face class</li>
  <li>Thank goodness for Justine</li>
  <li>Here is to ironing out all the wrinkles!</li>
